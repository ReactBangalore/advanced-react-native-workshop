Theres all this spanish text on my site i cant pay you , I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me, that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please yet there is too much white space for i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version so i cant pay you . Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy try making it a bit less blah could you move it a tad to the left. That sandwich needs to be more playful concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution. I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me. Make it pop what is a hamburger menu. I really like the colour but can you change it I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, but can you use a high definition screenshot jazz it up a little could you do an actual logo instead of a font something summery; colourful. There are more projects lined up charge extra the next time this was not according to brief, for low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, yet just do what you think. I trust you. Concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution. Can you make it more infographic-y.

      "description": "An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.\n\nIf Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.\n\nYou’re disgusting. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\"\n\nThis placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.\n\nYou could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.",
